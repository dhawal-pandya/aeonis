# Aeonis: An AI-Powered DevSecOps Platform

Aeonis is an observability platform designed to provide deep, AI-powered insights into your applications. It combines distributed tracing with a conversational AI interface, allowing developers to not only visualize application flow but also ask complex questions about their system's behavior, security, and performance.

Our vision is to create a comprehensive DevSecOps tool that helps developers:
- **Identify Security Risks**: Proactively detect potential data leaks by asking questions like, *"Is this change logging sensitive data to a webhook?"*
- **Understand Code Impact**: Analyze the ripple effects of changes, asking *"Where would a new feature require the fewest changes?"*
- **Optimize Performance**: Compare performance characteristics across different versions or feature flags, asking *"How did the last commit affect database query times?"*

## Core Components

The Aeonis ecosystem is being built as a monorepo and consists of three primary components:

1.  **`aeonis-tracer`**: A suite of language-specific SDKs that developers integrate into their applications. These tracers are lightweight, performant, and capture detailed operational data (spans) according to the OpenTelemetry standard.

2.  **`aeonis-server`**: The central nervous system of the platform. This server (likely to be built in Python) is responsible for:
    *   Ingesting trace data from the various SDKs.
    *   Storing the data in a time-series database (e.g., PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB).
    *   Providing an API for the web UI to query and display traces.
    *   Hosting the MCP (Multi-Context Prompter) server, which uses AI and RAG to answer natural language questions about the trace data.

3.  **`aeonis-ui`**: A modern, intuitive web frontend for visualizing and analyzing the collected traces. It will provide a rich interface for exploring service maps, trace flows, and interacting with the AI chat component.

## Current Project Status

This project is under active development. Here is the current status of the core components:

*   **Go Tracer SDK (`packages/tracer-sdk/go`):** âœ… **Complete and Tested**
    *   Fully functional Go SDK for instrumenting applications.
    *   Features asynchronous, batching export of trace data.
    *   Includes robust, built-in PII sanitization.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests have been written and are passing.
    *   Ready for deployment and integration into Go projects.

*   **Ingestion Server (`apps/aeonis-server`):** âœ… **Active and In Development**
    *   The server is built on FastAPI and connects to a PostgreSQL database.
    *   It features a secure, multi-tenant ingestion endpoint (`/v1/traces`) that authenticates requests using project-specific API keys.
    *   A repository pattern is in place to abstract database logic, making the system adaptable for future database technologies.

*   **Web UI (`apps/aeonis-ui`):** ðŸš§ **Up Next**
    *   Development of a basic trace visualization UI is the next priority.

## Monorepo Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure to simplify dependency management and ensure consistency across components.

*   `apps/`: Contains deployable applications (the server, the UI).
*   `packages/`: Contains shared libraries, specifications, and the tracer SDKs.
